Insert DIVI Library item inside module content or inside a php template by using a shortcode.

== Description ==
Using this tool you will be able to embed any Divi Library item inside another module content or inside a php template by using a simple shortcode.

You just need to build a layout, section or module inside the Divi library.

The shortcode can be copied from Divi Library screen (Shortcode column) or from the metabox inside the Divi builder.

Once you get shortcode copied (it looks like [showmodule id="866"]), you can insert it inside another module content or inside a php template.

I made a tutorial explaining how to use it : "DIVI Module inside module v2" available at the following URL :
